      "orders. Moreover, a retirement of this kind would have involved almost certainly the destruction of the fine \n",
      "Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the abandonment of the whole of Belgium. Therefore, when the force and \n",
      "scope of the German penetration were realized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, \n",
      "assumed command in place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British Armies in Belgium \n",

      "against serious raids, could have been given to our people. In the days of Napoleon the same wind which would \n",
      "have carried his transports across the Channel might have driven away the blockading fleet. There was always the \n",
